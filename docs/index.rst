MSIGen documentation
====================

MSIGen provides tools for processing mass spectrometry imaging data acquired in line-scan mode into images and figures.

This package takes line-scan files as an input and generates a numpy and json file as intermediate outputs containing the image data and metadata, respectively.
MSIGen also includes tools to visualize the generated images as images or figures with a title and colorbar. 
These images can be normalized to TIC, internal standard, or the brightest pixel.
Supported image types are ion images, fractional abundance images, or ratio images.

MSIGen supports multiple vendor and open-source file formats (Agilent .d, Bruker .tsf, .baf, .tdf, Thermo .raw, and open-source .mzML files) and can to handle MS, MS/MS with or without ion mobility data.

Installation instructions can be found on the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/LabLaskin/MSIGen>`_.
